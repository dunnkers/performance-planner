# performance-planner-assembler

This tool helps you assembly the correct amount of pages for my _Performance planner_. It is both a journal and a planner and helps you bring structure to your daily routine.

## About

This assembly app was built by [Jeroen Overschie](https://jeroenoverschie.nl/) in React.js ✌🏻. The performance planner itself was also built by me, but inspired by the _Passion Planner_.
